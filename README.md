# Personal-Diary
A diary is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by
date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal
diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience.

Digital Diary replacing the old hand-written system where person can store/create his/her event description with date specified. A person can create multiple events. A person can modify the existing events and can delete any specific event from his/her diary. Last Modification date is also recorded in the system. One unique feature of the system is a user can set the importance (high, moderate, less important) of any event. Each person can be uniquely identified by the system. After a successful login his/her diary of events are displayed on home screen.
